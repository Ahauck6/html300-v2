                <h1>Simple Garden Set Up</h1>
                <h2>What are we planting?</h2>
                <p>This garden is going to be a simple spin on the Three Sisters. We will be planting corn, beans, squash and lettuce.</p>
                <h2>What is the structure of the garden bed?</h2>
                <p>This garden is going to be done in a simple 4x6 raised bed. Instead of the usual circular formation, this bed will be structured in a linear pattern because of the addition of lettuce.</p>
                <h2>When is a good time to start planting?</h2>
                <p>Corn, beans, and squash are warm season plants. Lettuce is a cool season crop. It is best to have the seeds in the ground once temperatures at night are above 55 degrees and no later than May.</p>
                <h2>Where should I place my garden bed?</h2>
                <p>Any place that gets direct sunlight for at least 6 hours a day.</p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Sun_in_the_sky.jpg/1200px-Sun_in_the_sky.jpg?20091130174025" width="300" alt="Photo of the sun.">
                <h2>How are they pollinated?</h2>
                <p>Corn is pollinated by the wind. So to ensure the plant has the best chance at success it is best to plant corn in clusters. Squash is pollinated by pollinators like insects or hummingbirds so placing squash near one and other will help attract more pollinators. Beans and lettuce are self-pollinated.</p>
                <h2>How is everything spaced in the garden bed?</h2>
                <p>The corn is going to be sowed along one of the 6ft sides of the garden. Place a seed ever 8 inches in a staggered row. Once the corn grows to about 4 inches tall plant the beans about 6 inches away from the corn towards the center of the garden. About every 3 inches place a bean seed. And finally 1 week after the beans were planted place the squash every 2 feet along the other 6ft side of the bed. Inbetween the squash on the same row place the lettuce evenly spaced between the squash. Plant the lettuce the same time you plant the corn. So corn and lettuce go in the ground first followed by the beans and then the squash. Directly sow all of these plants into the ground. Corn, beans, and squash are known to not transplant well. Lettuce does fine being directly sown into the garden, which is perfect for keeping the garden simple.</p>
                <h2>Why structure the garden this way?</h2>
                <p>The corn will act as a trellis for the beans to wrap around as they grow so the corn must be planted first. Squash creates shade in the garden bed so to let the corn and bean seedling get the sun they need the squash is planted later. Lettuce is planted at the same time as the corn so the lettuce can be harvested before its slow growing neighbor (squash) takes over the space.</p>
