            <!--Purpose of the website-->
            <p>Every time warmer weather comes around I revisit the idea of starting a garden. However, along the way I 
              always start to feel overwhelmed by the endless options and knowledge that goes into growing a successful 
              luscious garden. I want to simplify that process and make it feel more approachable for newbie gardeners. This guide 
              will remain specific to the Pacific Northwest climate here in Washington.</p>
              <!--Use of tooltips-->
            <p>This will be a simple variation on the well known <a class="undo" href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="Originated in North America 3000 years ago!">Three Sisters</a>, which is campion planting started by the Iroquois. 
              Corn, beans, and squash help each other thrive, deter pest and enrich the soil. Corn provides tall stalks for the beans to climb.
              Beans provide nitrogen to the soil by taking it from the air and converting it so plant roots can absorb it. And the squash has 
              large leaves that shade the soil which helps to retain moisture and prevent weeds. The squash also has some prickly parts that 
              help keep small creatures away. Lettuce will be the added vegetable amoung the Three Sisters. It can easily be planted along side 
              the squash and harvested sooner than its slow growing neighbor. Have fun exploring and learning your way to no fuss garden bed. Our 
              website offers an instructive how-to-page for setting up your garden, recipe ideas utilizing ingredients straight from your 
              greenhorn garden, and fun facts about your four plant buddies.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of joy and fulfillment to be had in tending to your own garden, I hope through this website I 
              can remove the intimidation factor and present all the needed knowledge on a nice clean plate.</p>
